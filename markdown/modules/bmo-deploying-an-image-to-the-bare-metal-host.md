# Deploying an image to the bare-metal host {id="bmo-deploying-an-image-to-the-bare-metal-host_{{ context }}"}

To deploy the image to the host, update the `image` field in the `spec` section of the `BareMetalHost` resource. Once you update the `image` field, provisioning begins immediately. Deploying an image transforms bare hardware into a functional system
ready to run your workloads, in an automated and repeatable way. {._abstract}

**Procedure**

*   Update the `image` field in the `BareMetalHost` CR by running the following command:
    ```terminal
    $ oc patch baremetalhost <hostname> \
      --type merge -p '{"spec": {"image": {"url": "<image_url>", "checksum": "<checksum_url>", "checksumType": "auto"}}}'
    ```

    `<hostname>`
    :   The name of your `BareMetalHost` resource.

    `<image_url>`
    :   The URL of the image to deploy. You can access images using the HTTP and OCI protocols. Accessing images using the OCI protocol is available as a Technology Preview.

    `<checksum_url>`
    :   The URL of the checksum file for the image.
