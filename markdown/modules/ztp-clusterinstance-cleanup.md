# Deleting the Argo CD pipeline post-migration {id="ztp-clusterinstance-cleanup_{{ context }}"}

After you migrate all {{ sno }} clusters from using `SiteConfig` CRs to `ClusterInstance` CRs, you can delete the original Argo CD application and related resources that managed the `SiteConfig` CRs.


:::note

Only delete the Argo CD application and related resources after you have confirmed that all clusters are successfully managed by the new Argo CD application that uses `ClusterInstance` CRs. Additionally, if the Argo CD project was only used for the migrated cluster’s Argo application, you can also delete this project.

:::


**Prerequisites**

*   You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
*   All {{ sno }} clusters have been successfully migrated to use `ClusterInstance` CRs and are managed by another Argo CD application.

**Procedure**

1.  Delete the original Argo CD application that managed the `SiteConfig` CRs:
    ```bash
    $ oc delete application.argo clusters -n openshift-gitops
    ```
    *   Replace `clusters` with the name of your original Argo CD application.
1.  Delete the original Argo CD project by running the following command:
    ```bash
    $ oc delete appproject ztp-app-project -n openshift-gitops 
    ```
    *   Replace `ztp-app-project` with the name of your original Argo CD project.

**Verification**

1.  Confirm that the original Argo CD application is deleted by running the following command:
    ```bash
    $ oc get appproject -n openshift-gitops
    ```
    ```bash title="Example output"
    NAME                 AGE
    default              6d20h
    policy-app-project   2d22h
    ztpv2-app-project    44h
    ```
    *   The original Argo CD project in this example, `ztp-app-project` is not present in the output.
1.  Confirm that the original Argo CD project is deleted by running the following command:
    ```bash
    oc get applications.argo -n openshift-gitops
    ```
    ```bash title="Example output"
    NAME                       SYNC STATUS   HEALTH STATUS
    clusters-v2                Synced        Healthy
    policies                   Synced        Healthy
    ```
    *   The original Argo CD application in this example, `clusters` is not present in the output.
