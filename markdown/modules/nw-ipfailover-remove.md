# Removing IP failover {id="nw-ipfailover-remove_{{ context }}"}

To remove IP failover from your {{ product_title }} cluster and clean up iptables rules and virtual IP addresses, you can delete the deployment and service account, then run a cleanup job on each configured node. {._abstract}

When IP failover is initially configured, the worker nodes in the cluster are modified with an `iptables` rule that explicitly allows multicast packets on `224.0.0.18` for Keepalived. Because of the change to the nodes, removing IP failover requires running a job to remove the `iptables` rule and removing the virtual IP addresses used by Keepalived.

**Procedure**

1.  Optional: Identify and delete any check and notify scripts that are stored as config maps:
    1.  Identify whether any pods for IP failover use a config map as a volume:
        ```terminal
        $ oc get pod -l ipfailover \
          -o jsonpath="\
        {range .items[?(@.spec.volumes[*].configMap)]}
        {'Namespace: '}{.metadata.namespace}
        {'Pod:       '}{.metadata.name}
        {'Volumes that use config maps:'}
        {range .spec.volumes[?(@.configMap)]}  {'volume:    '}{.name}
          {'configMap: '}{.configMap.name}{'\n'}{end}
        {end}"
        ```
        ```text title="Example output"
        Namespace: default
        Pod:       keepalived-worker-59df45db9c-2x9mn
        Volumes that use config maps:
          volume:    config-volume
          configMap: mycustomcheck
        ```
    1.  If the preceding step provided the names of config maps that are used as volumes, delete the config maps:
        ```terminal
        $ oc delete configmap <configmap_name>
        ```
1.  Identify an existing deployment for IP failover:
    ```terminal
    $ oc get deployment -l ipfailover
    ```
    ```terminal title="Example output"
    NAMESPACE   NAME         READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    default     ipfailover   2/2     2            2           105d
    ```
1.  Delete the deployment:
    ```terminal
    $ oc delete deployment <ipfailover_deployment_name>
    ```
1.  Remove the `ipfailover` service account:
    ```terminal
    $ oc delete sa ipfailover
    ```
1.  Run a job that removes the IP tables rule that was added when IP failover was initially configured:
    1.  Create a file such as `remove-ipfailover-job.yaml` with contents that are similar to the following example:
        ```yaml
        apiVersion: batch/v1
        kind: Job
        metadata:
          generateName: remove-ipfailover-
          labels:
            app: remove-ipfailover
        spec:
          template:
            metadata:
              name: remove-ipfailover
            spec:
              containers:
              - name: remove-ipfailover
                image: registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ose-keepalived-ipfailover-rhel9:v{{ product_version }}
                command: ["/var/lib/ipfailover/keepalived/remove-failover.sh"]
              nodeSelector:
                kubernetes.io/hostname: <host_name>
              restartPolicy: Never
        ```
        *   The `nodeSelector` is likely the same as the selector used in the old IP failover deployment.
        *   Run the job for each node in your cluster that was configured for IP failover and replace the hostname each time.
    1.  Run the job:
        ```terminal
        $ oc create -f remove-ipfailover-job.yaml
        ```
        ```text title="Example output"
        job.batch/remove-ipfailover-2h8dm created
        ```

**Verification**

*   Confirm that the job removed the initial configuration for IP failover.
    ```terminal
    $ oc logs job/remove-ipfailover-2h8dm
    ```
    ```terminal title="Example output"
    remove-failover.sh: OpenShift IP Failover service terminating.
