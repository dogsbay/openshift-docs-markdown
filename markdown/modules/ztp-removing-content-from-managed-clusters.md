# Changing applied managed cluster CRs using policies {id="ztp-removing-content-from-managed-clusters_{{ context }}"}

You can remove content from a custom resource (CR) that is deployed in a managed cluster through a policy. {._abstract}

By default, all `Policy` CRs created from a `{{ policy_gen_cr }}` CR have the `complianceType` field set to `musthave`.
A `musthave` policy without the removed content is still compliant because the CR on the managed cluster has all the specified content.
With this configuration, when you remove content from a CR, {{ cgu_operator }} removes the content from the policy but the content is not removed from the CR on the managed cluster.

With the `complianceType` field to `mustonlyhave`, the policy ensures that the CR on the cluster is an exact match of what is specified in the policy.

**Prerequisites**

*   You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
*   You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
*   You have deployed a managed cluster from a hub cluster running {{ rh_rhacm }}.
*   You have installed {{ cgu_operator_full }} on the hub cluster.

**Procedure**

1.  Remove the content that you no longer need from the affected CRs. In this example, the `disableDrain: false` line was removed from the `SriovOperatorConfig` CR.

```yaml title="Example CR"
apiVersion: sriovnetwork.openshift.io/v1
kind: SriovOperatorConfig
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: openshift-sriov-network-operator
spec:
  configDaemonNodeSelector:
    "node-role.kubernetes.io/$mcp": ""
  disableDrain: true
  enableInjector: true
  enableOperatorWebhook: true
```

1.  Change the `complianceType` of the affected policies to `mustonlyhave` in the `{{ policy_prefix }}group-du-sno-ranGen.yaml` file.
    ```yaml title="Example YAML"
{%- if policy-gen-cr == "PolicyGenTemplate" %}
    - fileName: SriovOperatorConfig.yaml
      policyName: "config-policy"
      complianceType: mustonlyhave
{% endif %}
{% if policy-gen-cr == "PolicyGenerator" %}
    # ...
    policyDefaults:
      complianceType: "mustonlyhave"
    # ...
    policies:
      - name: config-policy
        policyAnnotations:
          ran.openshift.io/ztp-deploy-wave: ""
        manifests:
          - path: source-crs/SriovOperatorConfig.yaml
            {%- endif %}
    ```
1.  Create a `ClusterGroupUpdates` CR and specify the clusters that must receive the CR changes::
    ```yaml title="Example ClusterGroupUpdates CR"
    apiVersion: ran.openshift.io/v1alpha1
    kind: ClusterGroupUpgrade
    metadata:
      name: cgu-remove
      namespace: default
    spec:
      managedPolicies:
        - ztp-group.group-du-sno-config-policy
      enable: false
      clusters:
      - spoke1
      - spoke2
      remediationStrategy:
        maxConcurrency: 2
        timeout: 240
      batchTimeoutAction:
    ```
1.  Create the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR by running the following command:
    ```terminal
    $ oc create -f cgu-remove.yaml
    ```
1.  When you are ready to apply the changes, for example, during an appropriate maintenance window, change the value of the `spec.enable` field to `true` by running the following command:
    ```terminal
    $ oc --namespace=default patch clustergroupupgrade.ran.openshift.io/cgu-remove \
    --patch '{"spec":{"enable":true}}' --type=merge
    ```

**Verification**

1.  Check the status of the policies by running the following command:
    ```terminal
    $ oc get <kind> <changed_cr_name>
    ```

    ```terminal title="Example output"
    NAMESPACE   NAME                                                   REMEDIATION ACTION   COMPLIANCE STATE   AGE
    default     cgu-ztp-group.group-du-sno-config-policy               enforce                                 17m
    default     ztp-group.group-du-sno-config-policy                   inform               NonCompliant       15h
    ```


    When the `COMPLIANCE STATE` of the policy is `Compliant`, it means that the CR is updated and the unwanted content is removed.
1.  Check that the policies are removed from the targeted clusters by running the following command on the managed clusters:
    ```terminal
    $ oc get <kind> <changed_cr_name>
    ```


    If there are no results, the CR is removed from the managed cluster.
