# About the must-gather tool {id="cnf-about-must-gather_{{ context }}"}

To debug issues in your cluster, use the `oc adm must-gather` CLI command. This tool collects the diagnostic information most likely needed for troubleshooting, ensuring that you have the necessary data for analysis. {._abstract}

The `oc adm must-gather` CLI command collects the following information from your cluster:

*   Resource definitions
*   Audit logs
*   Service logs

You can specify one or more images when you run the command by including the `--image` argument. When you specify an image, the tool collects data related to that feature or product. When you run `oc adm must-gather`, a new pod is created on the cluster. The data is collected on that pod and saved in a new directory that starts with `must-gather.local`. This directory is created in your current working directory.
