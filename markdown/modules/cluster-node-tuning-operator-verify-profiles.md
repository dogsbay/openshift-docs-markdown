# Verifying that the TuneD profiles are applied {id="verifying-tuned-profiles-are-applied_{{ context }}"}

Verify the TuneD profiles that are applied to your cluster node. {._abstract}

**Procedure**

1.  Run the following command to verify the TuneD profiles that are applied to your cluster node:
    ```terminal
    $ oc get profile.tuned.openshift.io -n openshift-cluster-node-tuning-operator
    ```
    ```terminal title="Example output"
    NAME             TUNED                     APPLIED   DEGRADED   AGE
    master-0         openshift-control-plane   True      False      6h33m
    master-1         openshift-control-plane   True      False      6h33m
    master-2         openshift-control-plane   True      False      6h33m
    worker-a         openshift-node            True      False      6h28m
    worker-b         openshift-node            True      False      6h28m
    ```

    where:
    *   `NAME`: Name of the Profile object. There is one Profile object per node and their names match.
    *   `TUNED`: Name of the desired TuneD profile to apply.
    *   `APPLIED`: `True` if the TuneD daemon applied the desired profile. (`True/False/Unknown`).
    *   `DEGRADED`: `True` if any errors were reported during application of the TuneD profile (`True/False/Unknown`).
    *   `AGE`: Time elapsed since the creation of Profile object.
1.  Run the following command to get status information about the `ClusterOperator/node-tuning` object:
    ```terminal
    $ oc get co/node-tuning -n openshift-cluster-node-tuning-operator
    ```
    ```terminal title="Example output" {minja}
    NAME          VERSION   AVAILABLE   PROGRESSING   DEGRADED   SINCE   MESSAGE
    node-tuning   {{ product_version }}.1    True        False         True       60m     1/5 Profiles with bootcmdline conflict
    ```

    The `ClusterOperator/node-tuning` object also contains useful information about the Operator and its node agents' health. For example, Operator misconfiguration is reported by `ClusterOperator/node-tuning` status messages.

    If either the `ClusterOperator/node-tuning` or a profile object’s status is `DEGRADED`, additional information is provided in the Operator or operand logs.
