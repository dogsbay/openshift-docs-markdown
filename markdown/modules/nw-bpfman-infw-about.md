# Ingress Node Firewall Operator integration {id="ingress-node-firewall-operator_{{ context }}"}

Learn when to use eBPF Manager to load and manage Ingress Node Firewall programs. {._abstract}

The Ingress Node Firewall uses [eBPF](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/bpf/index.html) programs to implement some of its key firewall functionality. By default these eBPF programs are loaded into the kernel using a mechanism specific to the Ingress Node Firewall. You can configure the Ingress Node Firewall Operator to use the eBPF Manager Operator for loading and managing these programs instead.

When this integration is enabled, the following limitations apply:

*   The Ingress Node Firewall Operator uses TCX if XDP is not available and TCX is incompatible with bpfman.
*   The Ingress Node Firewall Operator daemon set pods remain in the `ContainerCreating` state until the firewall rules are applied.
*   The Ingress Node Firewall Operator daemon set pods run as privileged.
