# Configuring the networkData parameter in the BareMetalHost resource {id="bmo-configuring-the-networkdata-parameter-in-the-bmo-cr_{{ context }}"}

The `networkData` field in the `BareMetalHost` custom resource (CR) allows you to control the network configuration of the bare-metal host at creation time. For most operating systems, this is achieved using a configuration file encapsulated in a Kubernetes secret. Then, the `cloud-init` service uses it to customize services. {._abstract}

**Procedure**

1.  Create a file named `network-data.yaml` with the following content:
    ```yaml
    links:
      - id: <interface_id>
        type: phy
        ethernet_mac_address: <mac_address>
    networks:
      - id: <interface_id>
        link: <interface_id>
        type: ipv4_dhcp
    services:
      - type: dns
        address: <dns_server>
    ```

    `<interface_id>`
    :   The ID of the network interface, such as `enp2s0`.

    `<mac_address>`
    :   The MAC address of the network interface.

    `<dns_server>`
    :   The IP address of the DNS server.

1.  Create a secret from the `networkData` file by running the following command:
    ```terminal
    $ oc create secret generic <hostname>-network-data \
      --from-file=networkData=network-data.yaml -n bmaas
    ```

    `<hostname>`
    :   The hostname of the bare-metal host.

1.  Configure the `BareMetalHost` to use the `networkData` file by running the following command:
    ```terminal
    $ oc patch baremetalhost <hostname> -n bmaas \
      --type merge -p '{"spec":{"networkData":{"name":"<hostname>-network-data"}}}'
    ```
