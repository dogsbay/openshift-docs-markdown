# Per-tenant hierarchical governance and tenant autonomy {id="network-observability-per-tenant-hierarchical-governance-and-tenant-autonomy_{{ context }}"}

Cluster administrators can maintain global governance while allowing project administrators to manage network traffic observability within their specific namespaces. {._abstract}

The Network Observability Operator uses a hierarchical configuration model to support multitenancy. This architecture is beneficial for large-scale deployments and {{ hcp }} environments where individual teams require self-service visibility without cluster administrator intervention.

The hierarchical model consists of the following components:


Global governance
:   The cluster administrator manages the global `FlowCollector` resource. This resource defines the observability infrastructure and determines if per-tenant configuration is permitted.

Tenant autonomy
:   The project administrator manages the `FlowCollectorSlice` resource. This namespace-scoped custom resource (CR) allows teams to define specific observability settings for their workloads.
