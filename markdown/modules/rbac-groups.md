# Groups {id="rbac-groups_{{ context }}"}

Groups represent sets of users and simplify authorization management by allowing administrators to grant permissions to multiple users simultaneously rather than individually. {{ product_title }} includes both explicitly defined groups and automatically provisioned virtual groups. {._abstract}

In addition to explicitly defined groups, there are also
system groups, or _virtual groups_, that are automatically provisioned by
the cluster.

The following default virtual groups are most important:

| Virtual group | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `system:authenticated` | Automatically associated with all authenticated users. |
| `system:authenticated:oauth` | Automatically associated with all users authenticated with an OAuth access token. |
| `system:unauthenticated` | Automatically associated with all unauthenticated users. |
