# Creating custom build artifacts {id="builds-create-custom-build-artifacts_{{ context }}"}

You must create the image you want to use as your custom build image.

**Procedure**

1.  Starting with an empty directory, create a file named `Dockerfile` with the following content:
    ```terminal
    FROM registry.redhat.io/rhel8/buildah
    # In this example, `/tmp/build` contains the inputs that build when this
    # custom builder image is run. Normally the custom builder image fetches
    # this content from some location at build time, by using git clone as an example.
    ADD dockerfile.sample /tmp/input/Dockerfile
    ADD build.sh /usr/bin
    RUN chmod a+x /usr/bin/build.sh
    # /usr/bin/build.sh contains the actual custom build logic that will be run when
    # this custom builder image is run.
    ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/build.sh"]
    ```
1.  In the same directory, create a file named `dockerfile.sample`. This file is included in the custom build image and defines the image that is produced by the custom build:
    ```terminal
    FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi
    RUN touch /tmp/build
    ```
1.  In the same directory, create a file named `build.sh`. This file contains the logic that is run when the custom build runs:
    ```terminal
    #!/bin/sh
    # Note that in this case the build inputs are part of the custom builder image, but normally this
    # is retrieved from an external source.
    cd /tmp/input
    # OUTPUT_REGISTRY and OUTPUT_IMAGE are env variables provided by the custom
    # build framework
    TAG="${OUTPUT_REGISTRY}/${OUTPUT_IMAGE}"


    # performs the build of the new image defined by dockerfile.sample
    buildah --storage-driver vfs bud --isolation chroot -t ${TAG} .


    # buildah requires a slight modification to the push secret provided by the service
    # account to use it for pushing the image
    cp /var/run/secrets/openshift.io/push/.dockercfg /tmp
    (echo "{ \"auths\": " ; cat /var/run/secrets/openshift.io/push/.dockercfg ; echo "}") > /tmp/.dockercfg


    # push the new image to the target for the build
    buildah --storage-driver vfs push --tls-verify=false --authfile /tmp/.dockercfg ${TAG}
    ```
