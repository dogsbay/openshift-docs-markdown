# Configuring pod connectivity check placement {id="nw-pod-network-connectivity-configuration_{{ context }}"}

As a cluster administrator, you can configure which nodes the connectivity check pods run by modifying the `network.config.openshift.io` object named `cluster`.

**Prerequisites**

*   Install the {{ oc_first }}.

**Procedure**

1.  Edit the connectivity check configuration by entering the following command:
    ```terminal
    $ oc edit network.config.openshift.io cluster
    ```
1.  In the text editor, update the `networkDiagnostics` stanza to specify the node selectors that you want for the source and target pods.
1.  Save your changes and exit the text editor.

**Verification**

*   Verify that the source and target pods are running on the intended nodes by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get pods -n openshift-network-diagnostics -o wide
```
