# Configuring VRRP preemption {id="nw-ipfailover-configuring-vrrp-preemption_{{ context }}"}

To control VIP preemption behavior when nodes recover in {{ product_title }}, you can configure the `OPENSHIFT_HA_PREEMPTION` variable to set a delay before higher priority VIPs take over or disable preemption entirely. {._abstract}

When a virtual IP (VIP) on a node recovers from the `fault` state, it enters the `backup` state if it has a lower priority than the VIP currently in the `master` state.

There are two options for the `OPENSHIFT_HA_PREEMPTION` variable:

*   `nopreempt`: When set, the `master` role does not move from a lower-priority VIP to a higher-priority VIP.
*   `preempt_delay 300`: When set, Keepalived waits 300 seconds before moving the `master` role to the higher-priority VIP.

In the following example, the `OPENSHIFT_HA_PREEMPTION` value is set to `preempt_delay 300`.

**Procedure**

*   To specify preemption enter `oc edit deploy ipfailover-keepalived` to edit the router deployment configuration:
    ```terminal
    $ oc edit deploy ipfailover-keepalived
    ```
    ```yaml
    # ...
        spec:
          containers:
          - env:
            - name: OPENSHIFT_HA_PREEMPTION
              value: preempt_delay 300
    #...
    ```
