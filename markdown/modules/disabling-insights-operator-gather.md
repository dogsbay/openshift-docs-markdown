# Disabling the {{ insights_operator }} periodic gather operations {id="disabling-insights-operator-gather_{{ context }}"}

You can optionally disable the periodic `InsightsDataGather` operations that the {{ insights_operator }} runs every 2 hours by default. Disabling the periodic data gather operations increases privacy for your organization as {{ insights_operator }} will no longer gather and send {{ red_hat_lightspeed }} cluster reports to Red&#160;Hat. {._abstract}

Disabling gather operations will also disable {{ red_hat_lightspeed }} analysis and recommendations for your cluster without affecting other core functions that require communication with Red&#160;Hat such as cluster transfers.

You can view a list of attempted gather operations for your cluster from the `/insights-operator/gathers.json` file in your {{ insights_operator }} archive. Be aware that some gather operations occur only when certain conditions are met and might not show in your most recent archive.

:::note

If you enable Technology Preview in your cluster, the {{ insights_operator }} runs gather operations in individual pods. This is part of the Technology Preview feature set for the {{ insights_operator }} and supports the new data gathering features.

**Prerequisites**

{% if not (openshift_rosa or openshift_dedicated) %}
*   You are logged in to the {{ product_title }} web console as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
{% endif %}
{% if openshift_rosa or openshift_dedicated %}
*   You are logged in to the {{ product_title }} web console as a user with the `dedicated-admin` role.
{% endif %}

**Procedure**

1.  Navigate to **Administration** > **CustomResourceDefinitions**.
1.  On the **CustomResourceDefinitions** page, use the **Search by name** field to find the **InsightsDataGather** custom resource definition (CRD), and click to open.
1.  On the **CustomResourceDefinition details** page, click the **Instances** tab.
1.  Click **cluster**, and then click the **YAML** tab.
1.  Edit the `InsightsDataGather` CRD, and complete one of the following steps:
    *   To disable all the gather operations and data collection, define the `gatherers` specification and set the `mode` to `None`:
        ```yaml

        apiVersion: insights.openshift.io/v1
        kind: InsightsDataGather
        metadata:
          name: cluster
        spec:
        # Gatherers configuration
          gatherers:
            mode: None # Options: All, None, Custom
        ```
    *   To disable individual gather operations, under `gatherers`, set the `mode` to `Custom` and then specify the individual gatherer that you intend to disable. For example, to disable the workload gatherer, define the following specification:
        ```yaml
        apiVersion: insights.openshift.io/v1
        kind: InsightsDataGather
        metadata:
          name: cluster
        spec:
            # Gatherers configuration
          gatherers:
            mode: Custom  # Options: All, None, Custom
            custom:
              configs:
                # Essential cluster configuration gatherers
                - name: clusterconfig/authentication
                  state: Enabled
                - name: clusterconfig/clusteroperators
                  state: Enabled
                - name: workloads
                  state: Disabled
        ```
1.  Click **Save**.

**Results**

The {{ insights_operator }} updates the gather configurations and no longer runs the operations that you disabled.


:::note

Disabling gather operations restricts the ability of the {{ red_hat_lightspeed }} advisor service to offer effective recommendations for your cluster.
