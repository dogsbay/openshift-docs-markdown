# Configuring dual-stack networking for an EgressIP object {id="nw-egress-ips-object-dual-stack_{{ context }}"}

For a cluster configured for dual-stack networking, you can apply dual-stack networking to a single `EgressIP` object. The `EgressIP` object can then extend dual-stack networking capabilities to a pod. {._abstract}


:::important

Red&#160;Hat does not support creating two `EgressIP` objects to represent dual-stack networking capabilities. For example, specifying IPv4 addresses with one object and using another object to specify IPv6 addresses. This configuration limit impacts address-type assignments to pods. 

:::


**Prerequisites**

*   You created two egress nodes so that an `EgressIP` object can allocate IPv4 addresses to one node and IPv6 addresses to the other node. For more information, see "Assignment of egress IP addresses to nodes".

**Procedure**

*   Create an `EgressIP` object and configure IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for the object. The following example `EgressIP` object uses selectors to identify which pods use the specified egress IP addresses for their outbound traffic:
    ```yaml
    kind: EgressIP
    metadata:
      name: egressip-dual
    spec:
      egressIPs:
        - 192.168.118.30
        - 2600:52:7:94::30
      namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          env: qa
      podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          egressip: ds  
    # ...
    ```

**Verification**

1.  Create a `Pod` manifest file to test and validate your `EgressIP` object. The pod serves as a client workload that sends outbound traffic to verify that your `EgressIP` policy works as expected. 
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: ubi-egressip-pod
      namespace: test
      labels:
        egressip: ds
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: fedora-curl
        image: registry.redhat.io/ubi9/ubi
        command: ["/bin/bash", "-c", "sleep infinity"]
    # ...
    ```
    where:


    `<labels>`
    :   Sets custom identifiers so that the `EgressIP` object can use these labels to apply egress IP address to target pods.
1.  Run a `curl` request from inside a pod to an external server. This action verifies that outbound traffic correctly uses an address that you specified in the `EgressIP` object.
    ```terminal
    $ curl <ipv_address>
    ```
    where:


    `<ipv_address>`
    :   Depending on the `EgressIP` object, enter an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
