# Runtime configuration for an InfiniBand-based SR-IOV attachment {id="nw-sriov-runtime-config-sriov-ib_{{ context }}"}

When attaching a pod to an additional network, you can specify a runtime configuration to make specific customizations for the pod. For example, you can request a specific MAC hardware address. {._abstract}

You specify the runtime configuration by setting an annotation in the pod specification. The annotation key is `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks`, and it accepts a JSON object that describes the runtime configuration.

The following JSON describes the runtime configuration options for an InfiniBand-based SR-IOV network attachment.

```json
[
  {
    "name": "<network_attachment>",
    "infiniband-guid": "<guid>",
    "ips": ["<cidr_range>"]
  }
]
```

where:


`name`
:   The name of the SR-IOV network attachment definition CR.

`infiniband-guid`
:   The InfiniBand GUID for the SR-IOV device. To use this feature, you also must specify `{ "infinibandGUID": true }` in the `SriovIBNetwork` object.

`ips`
:   The IP addresses for the SR-IOV device that is allocated from the resource type defined in the SR-IOV network attachment definition CR. Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are supported. To use this feature, you also must specify `{ "ips": true }` in the `SriovIBNetwork` object.
