# Flowlogs-Pipeline does not consume network flows after installing Kafka {id="configure-network-traffic-flowlogs-pipeline-kafka_{{ context }}"}

Resolve issues where the flow-pipeline fails to consume network flows from Kafka by manually restarting the flow-pipeline pods to restore the connection between the flow collector and your Kafka deployment. {._abstract}

If you deployed the flow collector first with `deploymentModel: KAFKA` and then deployed Kafka, the flow collector might not connect correctly to Kafka. Manually restart the flow-pipeline pods where Flowlogs-pipeline does not consume network flows from Kafka.

**Procedure**

1.  Delete the flow-pipeline pods to restart them by running the following command:
    ```terminal
    $ oc delete pods -n netobserv -l app=flowlogs-pipeline-transformer
    ```
