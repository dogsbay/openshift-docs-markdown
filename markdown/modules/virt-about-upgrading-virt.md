# About updating {{ VirtProductName }} {id="virt-about-upgrading-virt_{{ context }}"}

When you install {{ VirtProductName }}, you select an update channel and an approval strategy. Both settings affect supportability. {._abstract}

The update channel determines the version of {{ VirtProductName }} that you use. The approval strategy determines whether updates occur automatically or require manual approval.

## Recommended settings {id="recommended-settings_{{ context }}"}

To keep a supportable environment, use the following settings:

*   Update channel: **stable**
*   Approval strategy: **Automatic**

Most {{ VirtProductName }} installations use the **stable** release channel and the **Automatic** approval strategy. Use other settings only if you understand the risks.

With these settings, the update process starts automatically when a new Operator version is available in the **stable** channel. This keeps {{ VirtProductName }} and {{ product_title }} versions compatible and ensures that {{ VirtProductName }} is suitable for production environments.


:::note

Each minor version of {{ VirtProductName }} is supported only with the corresponding {{ product_title }} version. For example, you must run {{ VirtProductName }} {{ VirtVersion }} on {{ product_title }} {{ VirtVersion }}.

## What to expect {id="what-to-expect_{{ context }}"}

You can expect consistent update behavior in {{ VirtProductName }}, including duration, automation, and data preservation.

*   The time required to complete an update depends on your network connection. Most automatic updates complete within fifteen minutes.
*   Updating {{ VirtProductName }} does not interrupt network connections.
*   An update preserves data volumes and their associated persistent volume claims.

:::important

If virtual machines use hostpath provisioner storage, they cannot be live migrated and might block an {{ product_title }} cluster update.

As a workaround, reconfigure the virtual machines so they can power off automatically during a cluster update. Set the `evictionStrategy` field to `None` and the `runStrategy` field to `Always`.

If virtual machines use AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS) storage, they cannot be live migrated and might block an {{ product_title }} cluster update.

As a workaround, reconfigure the virtual machines so they can power off automatically during a cluster update. Set the `evictionStrategy` field to `None` and the `runStrategy` field to `Always`.

## How updates work {id="how-updates-work_{{ context }}"}

Learn how Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) updates the {{ VirtProductName }} Operator and how update channels and approval strategies affect upgrade behavior.

*   Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) manages the lifecycle of the {{ VirtProductName }} Operator. The Marketplace Operator, deployed during {{ product_title }} installation, makes external Operators available to your cluster.
*   OLM provides z-stream and minor version updates for {{ VirtProductName }}. Minor version updates become available when you update {{ product_title }} to the next minor version. You cannot update {{ VirtProductName }} to the next minor version without first updating {{ product_title }}.
