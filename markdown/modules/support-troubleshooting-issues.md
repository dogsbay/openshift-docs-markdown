As an administrator, you can minimize the downtime for {{ product_title }} by monitoring system health and applying specific troubleshooting procedures. {._abstract}

You can troubleshoot these components by using the following procedures:

{% if not (openshift_rosa or openshift_rosa_hcp or openshift_dedicated) %}
*   **Installation issues**: {{ product_title }} installation proceeds through various stages. You can perform the following:
    *   Monitor the installation stages.
    *   Determine at which stage installation issues occur.
    *   Investigate multiple installation issues.
    *   Gather logs from a failed installation.
{% endif %}
*   **Node issues**: A cluster administrator can verify and troubleshoot node-related issues by reviewing the status, resource usage, and configuration of a node. You can query the following:
    *   Kubelet’s status on a node.
    *   Cluster node journal logs.

{% if not (openshift_rosa or openshift_rosa_hcp or openshift_dedicated) %}
*   **Crio issues**: A cluster administrator can verify CRI-O container runtime engine status on each cluster node. If you experience container runtime issues, perform the following:
    *   Gather CRI-O journald unit logs.
    *   Cleaning CRI-O storage.
*   **Operating system issues**: {{ product_title }}  runs on Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS. If you experience operating system issues, you can investigate kernel crash procedures. Ensure the following:
    *   Enable kdump.
    *   Test the kdump configuration.
    *   Analyze a core dump.
{% endif %}

{% if not (openshift_rosa or openshift_rosa_hcp or openshift_dedicated) %}
*   **Network issues**: To troubleshoot Open vSwitch issues, a cluster administrator can perform the following:
    *   Configure the Open vSwitch log level temporarily.
    *   Configure the Open vSwitch log level permanently.
    *   Display Open vSwitch logs.
{% endif %}
*   **Operator issues**: A cluster administrator can do the following to resolve Operator issues:
    *   Verify Operator subscription status.
    *   Check Operator pod health.
    *   Gather Operator logs.
*   **Pod issues**: A cluster administrator can troubleshoot pod-related issues by reviewing the status of a pod and completing the following:
    *   Review pod and container logs.
    *   Start debug pods with root access.
*   **Source-to-image issues**: A cluster administrator can observe the S2I stages to determine where in the S2I process a failure occurred. Gather the following to resolve Source-to-Image (S2I) issues:
    *   Source-to-Image diagnostic data.
    *   Application diagnostic data to investigate application failure.
*   **Storage issues**: A multi-attach storage error occurs when the mounting volume on a new node is not possible because the failed node cannot unmount the attached volume. A cluster administrator can do the following to resolve multi-attach storage issues:
    *   Enable multiple attachments by using RWX volumes.
    *   Recover or delete the failed node when using an RWO volume.
*   **Monitoring issues**: A cluster administrator can follow the procedures on the troubleshooting page for monitoring. If the metrics for your user-defined projects are unavailable or if Prometheus is consuming a lot of disk space, check the following:
    *   Investigate why user-defined metrics are unavailable.
    *   Determine why Prometheus is consuming a lot of disk space.
*   **{{ oc_first }} issues**: Investigate {{ oc_first }} issues by increasing the log level.
