# Using signing with Kernel Module Management (KMM) {id="kmm-using-signing-with-kmm_{{ context }}"}

On Secure Boot-enabled {{ product_title }} systems, out-of-tree kernel modules must be signed with keys enrolled in the Machine Owner’s Key (MOK) database. For kernel modules built out of tree, KMM supports signing kmods through the `sign` section of the kernel mapping in a `Module` custom resource. {._abstract}

For more details on using Secure Boot, see "Generating a public and private key pair".

## Prerequisites {id="kmm-using-signing-with-kmm-prerequisites_{{ context }}"}

*   A public private key pair in the correct (DER) format.
*   At least one secure-boot enabled node with the public key enrolled in its MOK database.
*   Either a pre-built driver container image, or the source code and Dockerfile needed to build one in-cluster.
