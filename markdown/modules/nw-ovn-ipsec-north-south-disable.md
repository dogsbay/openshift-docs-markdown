# Disabling IPsec encryption for an external IPsec endpoint {id="nw-ovn-ipsec-north-south-disable_{{ context }}"}

To stop encrypting traffic to an external host in {{ product_title }}, you can remove the IPsec tunnel configuration from your cluster nodes. {._abstract}

**Prerequisites**

*   Install the {{ oc_first }}.
*   You are logged in to the cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
*   You enabled IPsec in either `Full` or `External` mode on your cluster.

**Procedure**

1.  Create a file named `remove-ipsec-tunnel.yaml` with the following YAML:
    ```yaml
    kind: NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy
    apiVersion: nmstate.io/v1
    metadata:
      name: <name>
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        kubernetes.io/hostname: <node_name>
      desiredState:
        interfaces:
        - name: <tunnel_name>
          type: ipsec
          state: absent
    ```
    where:


    `name`
    :   Specifies a name for the node network configuration policy.

    `node_name`
    :   Specifies the name of the node where the IPsec tunnel that you want to remove exists.

    `tunnel_name`
    :   Specifies the interface name for the existing IPsec tunnel.
1.  To remove the IPsec tunnel, enter the following command:
    ```terminal
    $ oc apply -f remove-ipsec-tunnel.yaml
    ```
