# Example secondary external gateway configurations {id="example-secondary-external-gateway-configurations_{{ context }}"}

Reference the `AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute` objects to better understand secondary external gateway configurations. {._abstract}

In the following example, the `AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute` object configures two static IP addresses as external gateways for pods in namespaces with the `kubernetes.io/metadata.name: novxlan-externalgw-ecmp-4059` label:

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.ovn.org/v1
kind: AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute
metadata:
  name: default-route-policy
spec:
  from:
    namespaceSelector:
      matchLabels:
        kubernetes.io/metadata.name: novxlan-externalgw-ecmp-4059
  nextHops:
    static:
    - ip: "172.18.0.8"
    - ip: "172.18.0.9"
# ...
```

In the following example, the `AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute` object configures a dynamic external gateway. The IP addresses used for the external gateway are derived from the additional network attachments associated with each of the selected pods.

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.ovn.org/v1
kind: AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute
metadata:
  name: shadow-traffic-policy
spec:
  from:
    namespaceSelector:
      matchLabels:
        externalTraffic: ""
  nextHops:
    dynamic:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          gatewayPod: ""
      namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          shadowTraffic: ""
      networkAttachmentName: shadow-gateway
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          gigabyteGW: ""
      namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          gatewayNamespace: ""
      networkAttachmentName: gateway
# ...
```

In the following example, the `AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute` object configures both static and dynamic external gateways:

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.ovn.org/v1
kind: AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute
metadata:
  name: multi-hop-policy
spec:
  from:
    namespaceSelector:
      matchLabels:
        trafficType: "egress"
  nextHops:
    static:
    - ip: "172.18.0.8"
    - ip: "172.18.0.9"
    dynamic:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          gatewayPod: ""
      namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          egressTraffic: ""
      networkAttachmentName: gigabyte
# ...
```
