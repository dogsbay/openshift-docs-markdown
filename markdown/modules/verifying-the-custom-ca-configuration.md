# Verifying the custom CA configuration {id="verifying-the-custom-ca-configuration_{{ context }}"}

To verify that your custom CA certificate has been successfully added to the {{ product_title }} cluster-wide trust bundle, you can view the contents of the trusted-ca-bundle `ConfigMap` object and check that your certificate is included. {._abstract}

**Prerequisites**

*   You have permissions to view `ConfigMap` objects in the openshift-config namespace.
*   You have the {{ oc_first }} installed.

**Procedure**

1.  Run the following command to view the contents of the cluster-wide CA trust bundle:
    ```terminal
    $ oc get configmap trusted-ca-bundle -n openshift-config -o yaml
    ```
1.  In the YAML output, inspect the `data.ca-bundle.crt` field. This field contains all the trusted certificates for the cluster.
1.  Verify that the PEM-encoded certificate you added is included in the list of certificates. The output will resemble the following structure:
    ```yaml
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: trusted-ca-bundle
      namespace: openshift-config
    data:
      ca-bundle.crt: |
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        <A_SYSTEM_CA_CERTIFICATE>
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        <ANOTHER_SYSTEM_CA_CERTIFICATE>
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        <YOUR_CUSTOM_CA_CERTIFICATE_SHOULD_BE_HERE>
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    ```

    If your certificate is present in the output, the cluster now trusts your custom PKI.
