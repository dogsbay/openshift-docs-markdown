# Collecting Windows application event logs {id="collecting-windows-application-event-logs_{{ context }}"}

The `Get-WinEvent` shim on the kubelet `logs` endpoint can be used to collect application event logs from Windows machines. {._abstract}

**Prerequisites**

*   You installed the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).
*   You have created a Windows compute machine set.

**Procedure**

*   To view logs from all applications logging to the event logs on the Windows machine, run:
    ```terminal
    $ oc adm node-logs -l kubernetes.io/os=windows --path=journal
    ```

    The same command is executed when collecting logs with `oc adm must-gather`.

    Other Windows application logs from the event log can also be collected by specifying the respective service with a `-u` flag. For example, you can run the following command to collect logs for the containerd container runtime service:
    ```terminal
    $ oc adm node-logs -l kubernetes.io/os=windows --path=journal -u containerd
    ```
