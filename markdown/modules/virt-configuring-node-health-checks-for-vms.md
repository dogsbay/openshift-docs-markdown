# Configuring node health checks for virtual machines {id="virt-configuring-node-health-checks-for-vms_{{ context }}"}

You can configure the Node Health Check Operator to monitor node status and trigger automated remediation when a node becomes unhealthy. {._abstract}

**Prerequisites**

*   You have installed the Node Health Check Operator.
*   You have installed a remediation operator.
*   You have cluster administrator privileges.

**Procedure**

1.  Create a `NodeHealthCheck` custom resource (CR) to define the health check criteria and remediation strategy:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: remediation.medik8s.io/v1alpha1
    kind: NodeHealthCheck
    metadata:
      name: nodehealthcheck-sample
    spec:
      minHealthy: <count>
      pauseRequests:
        - <pause_test_cluster>
      remediationTemplate:
        apiVersion: self-node-remediation.medik8s.io/v1alpha1
        name: self-node-remediation-automatic-strategy-template
        namespace: openshift-workload-availability
        kind: SelfNodeRemediationTemplate
      escalatingRemediations:
        - remediationTemplate:
            apiVersion: self-node-remediation.medik8s.io/v1alpha1
            name: self-node-remediation-resource-deletion-template
            namespace: openshift-workload-availability
            kind: SelfNodeRemediationTemplate
          order: 1
          timeout: 300s
      selector:
        matchExpressions:
          - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/worker
            operator: Exists
      unhealthyConditions:
        - type: Ready
          status: "False"
          duration: 30s
        - type: Ready
          status: Unknown
          duration: 30s
    ```

    where:
    *   `spec.minHealthy` defines the number of worker nodes required to host VMs that migrate from failed nodes.
        *   For critical environments, set this value to the minimum number of nodes that you require to maintain the cluster workload.
        *   For hyperconverged storage, set this value to one less than your number of nodes to limit remediation to a single worker-node failure and maintain storage stability.
    *   `spec.remediationTemplate` defines the remediation template to use when the Node Health Check Operator detects an unhealthy node. This example uses the Self Node Remediation Operator.
    *   `spec.escalatingRemediations` defines escalating remediation strategies. If the initial remediation does not resolve the issue within the specified timeout, the next remediation strategy runs.
    *   `spec.selector` defines the nodes to monitor. This example monitors all worker nodes.
    *   `spec.unhealthyConditions` defines the parameters to identify an unhealthy node.
    *   `spec.unhealthyConditions.duration` defines the duration that a condition must persist before remediation starts. Set lower values for faster recovery. The following table shows recommended values:
        **Recommended `unhealthyConditions` duration values**

        | Environment | Recommended duration |
        | --- | --- |
        | Critical | 30-60 seconds |
        | Standard | 60-180 seconds |
        | Conservative | 180-360 seconds |
1.  Apply the `NodeHealthCheck` CR by running the following command:
    ```terminal
    $ oc apply -f nodehealthcheck-sample.yaml
    ```

**Verification**

*   Verify that the `NodeHealthCheck` CR exists by running the following command:
    ```terminal
    $ oc get nodehealthcheck nodehealthcheck-sample
    ```


:::tip

If remediation does not trigger as expected, verify that the remediation Operator runs correctly, and check the `NodeHealthCheck` CR events for errors:

```terminal
$ oc describe nodehealthcheck nodehealthcheck-sample
```
