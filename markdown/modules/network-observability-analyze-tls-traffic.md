# Analyze Transport Layer Security traffic data {id="network-observability-analyze-tls-traffic_{{ context }}"}

View and filter Transport Layer Security (TLS) metadata to identify deprecated configurations and verify encryption compliance in the cluster. {._abstract}

**Prerequisites**

*   The Network Observability Operator is installed.
*   TLS tracking is enabled in the `FlowCollector` custom resource (CR).
*   Access to the {{ product_title }} web console.

**Procedure**

1.  Navigate to **Observe** → **Network Traffic** in the {{ product_title }} web console and click the **Traffic flows** tab.

    :::note

    The **TLS Version** column is enabled by default. If the default TLS version column is not visible after enabling TLS tracking, click **Restore default columns** in **Manage columns** to refresh the table.
    
    :::

1.  Add TLS-specific columns to the traffic table:
    1.  Click **Manage columns**.
    1.  Select the **TLS Cipher Suite**, **TLS Group**, and **TLS Types** checkboxes.
    1.  Click **Save**.
1.  Filter traffic by message type to view complete TLS metadata:
    1.  In the filter bar, select **TLS Types** and choose **ServerHello** from the dropdown menu.

        `ServerHello` messages contain negotiated TLS metadata such as cipher suite and cryptographic group information.
1.  Filter traffic by TLS version to identify deprecated configurations:
    1.  In the filter bar, select **TLS Version**.
    1.  Select the versions you want to review:
        *   **1.0**: Deprecated
        *   **1.1**: Deprecated
        *   **1.2**: Legacy
        *   **1.3**: Current standard

            To identify all deprecated connections, filter for TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1.
1.  Analyze TLS metrics in the overview panel:
    1.  Click the **Overview** tab.
    1.  Review the default TLS panels, which include **TLS usage (network flows per second)** and **TLS per version (network flows per second)**.
    1.  Optional: To view additional TLS metrics, click **Manage panels** to select and display additional panels, such as **TLS per group (network flows per second)** or **TLS per cipher suite (network flows per second)**.
1.  Identify secure connections in the **Topology** view:
    1.  Click the **Topology** tab.

        Connections secured with TLS are marked with a lock icon. The color of the lock icon indicates the security level:
        *   **Red**: Deprecated TLS versions (1.0 or 1.1)
        *   **Yellow**: Legacy configurations (TLS 1.2)
        *   **Green**: Secure connections (TLS 1.3)
        *   **Blue**: Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) compliant

            Select a connection node to view its specific TLS version and cipher suite details.
1.  View TLS metrics in the Network Observability dashboard:
    1.  Navigate to **Observe** → **Dashboards**.
    1.  Search for **NetObserv** and review the available metrics:
        *   **TLS Traffic**: Displays overall TLS traffic metrics.
        *   **Flows rate per TLS version**: Displays traffic trends by TLS version over time.
        *   **Flows rate per TLS group**: Displays traffic by TLS group over time.
