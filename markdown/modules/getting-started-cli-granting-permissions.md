# Granting view permissions {id="getting-started-cli-granting-permissions_{{ context }}"}

Configure the necessary permissions for the application to access the required cluster resources. {._abstract}

{{ product_title }} automatically creates several service accounts in every project. The `default` service account takes responsibility for running the pods. {{ product_title }} uses and injects this service account into every pod that launches.

By default, the `default` service account has limited permissions to interact with the OpenShift API.

As a requirement of the application, you must assign the `view` role to the `default` service account to allow it to communicate with the OpenShift API to learn about pods, services, and resources within the project.

**Prerequisites**

*   You have access to an {{ product_title }} cluster.
*   You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
*   You have `cluster-admin` or project-level `admin` privileges.

**Procedure**

*   Add the `view` role to the `default` service account in the `user-getting-started` project by running the following command:
    ```terminal
    $ oc adm policy add-role-to-user view -z default -n user-getting-started
    ```

    :::important

    If you are using a different project, replace `user-getting-started` with the name of your project.
