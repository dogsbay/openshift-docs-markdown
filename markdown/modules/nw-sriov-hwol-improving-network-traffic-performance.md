# Improving network traffic performance using a virtual function {id="improving-network-traffic-performance-using-vf_{{ context }}"}

Follow this procedure to assign a virtual function to the OVN-Kubernetes management port and increase its network traffic performance. {._abstract}

This procedure results in the creation of two pools: the first has a virtual function used by OVN-Kubernetes, and the second comprises the remaining virtual functions.

**Prerequisites**

*   You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
*   You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

**Procedure**

1.  Add the `network.operator.openshift.io/smart-nic` label to each worker node with a SmartNIC present by running the following command:
    ```terminal
    $ oc label node <node-name> network.operator.openshift.io/smart-nic=
    ```

    Use the `oc get nodes` command to get a list of the available nodes.
1.  Create a policy named `sriov-node-mgmt-vf-policy.yaml` for the management port with content such as the following example:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: sriovnetwork.openshift.io/v1
    kind: SriovNetworkNodePolicy
    metadata:
      name: sriov-node-mgmt-vf-policy
      namespace: openshift-sriov-network-operator
    spec:
      deviceType: netdevice
      eSwitchMode: "switchdev"
      nicSelector:
        deviceID: "1019"
        rootDevices:
        - 0000:d8:00.0
        vendor: "15b3"
        pfNames:
        - <pf_name>#0-0
      nodeSelector:
        network.operator.openshift.io/smart-nic: ""
      numVfs: <num_vfs>
      priority: 5
      resourceName: mgmtvf
    ```
    *   `<pf_name>` specifies the network device for your use case. The `#0-0` part of the `pfNames` value reserves a single virtual function used by OVN-Kubernetes.
    *   `<num_vfs>` specifies the number of virtual functions. Replace this value with one that meets your requirements. For more information, see _SR-IOV network node configuration object_ in the _Additional resources_ section.
1.  Create a policy named `sriov-node-policy.yaml` with content such as the following example:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: sriovnetwork.openshift.io/v1
    kind: SriovNetworkNodePolicy
    metadata:
      name: sriov-node-policy
      namespace: openshift-sriov-network-operator
    spec:
      deviceType: netdevice
      eSwitchMode: "switchdev"
      nicSelector:
        deviceID: "1019"
        rootDevices:
        - 0000:d8:00.0
        vendor: "15b3"
        pfNames:
        - <pf_name>#1-5
      nodeSelector:
        network.operator.openshift.io/smart-nic: ""
      numVfs: <num_vfs>
      priority: 5
      resourceName: mlxnics
    ```
    *   `<pf_name>` specifies the network device for your use case.
    *   `<num_vfs>` specifies the number of virtual functions. Replace this value with the value specified in the `sriov-node-mgmt-vf-policy.yaml` file. For more information, see _SR-IOV network node configuration object_ in the _Additional resources_ section.

    :::note

    The `sriov-node-mgmt-vf-policy.yaml` file has different values for the `pfNames` and `resourceName` keys than the `sriov-node-policy.yaml` file.
    
    :::

1.  Apply the configuration for both policies:
    ```terminal
    $ oc create -f sriov-node-policy.yaml
    ```
    ```terminal
    $ oc create -f sriov-node-mgmt-vf-policy.yaml
    ```
1.  Create a Cluster Network Operator (CNO) ConfigMap in the cluster for the management configuration:
    1.  Create a ConfigMap named `hardware-offload-config.yaml` with the following contents:
        ```yaml
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: ConfigMap
        metadata:
            name: hardware-offload-config
            namespace: openshift-network-operator
        data:
            mgmt-port-resource-name: openshift.io/mgmtvf
        ```
    1.  Apply the configuration for the ConfigMap:
        ```terminal
        $ oc create -f hardware-offload-config.yaml
        ```
