# Configuring virtual machine (VM) secondary network interfaces for Network Observability {id="network-observability-virtualization-config_{{ context }}"}

Configure the `FlowCollector` to monitor VM secondary network traffic by setting the eBPF agent to `privileged` mode and defining the indexing for secondary networks, enabling the capture and enrichment of flows from {{ VirtProductName }}. {._abstract}

Network flows coming from VMs that are connected to the default internal pod network are automatically captured by network observability.

**Procedure**

1.  Get information about the virtual machine launcher pod by running the following command. This information is used in Step 5:
    ```terminal
    $ oc get pod virt-launcher-<vm_name>-<suffix> -n <namespace> -o yaml
    ```
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      annotations:
        k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/network-status: |-
          [{
            "name": "ovn-kubernetes",
            "interface": "eth0",
            "ips": [
              "10.129.2.39"
            ],
            "mac": "0a:58:0a:81:02:27",
            "default": true,
            "dns": {}
          },
          {
            "name": "my-vms/l2-network",
            "interface": "podc0f69e19ba2",
            "ips": [
              "10.10.10.15"
            ],
            "mac": "02:fb:f8:00:00:12",
            "dns": {}
          }]
      name: virt-launcher-fedora-aqua-fowl-13-zr2x9
      namespace: my-vms
    spec:
    #  ...
    status:
    #  ...
    ```

    where:

    `name`
    :   Specifies the name of the secondary network.

    `interface`
    :   Specifies the network interface of the secondary network.

    `ips`
    :   Specifies the list of IP addresses used by the secondary network.

    `mac`
    :   Specifies the MAC address used for the secondary network.

1.  In the web console, navigate to **Ecosystem** -> **Installed Operators**.
1.  Under the **Provided APIs** heading for the **NetObserv Operator**, select **Flow Collector**.
1.  Select **cluster** and then select the **YAML** tab.
1.  Configure `FlowCollector` based on the information you found from the additional network investigation:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: flows.netobserv.io/v1beta2
    kind: FlowCollector
    metadata:
      name: cluster
    spec:
      agent:
        ebpf:
          privileged: true
      processor:
        advanced:
          secondaryNetworks:
          - index:
            - MAC
            name: my-vms/l2-network
    # ...
    ```

    where:

    `spec.agent.ebpf.privileged`
    :   Specifies that the eBPF agent runs in `privileged` mode, which is required to collect flows from secondary network interfaces on virtual machine launcher pods.

    `spec.processor.advanced.secondaryNetworks.index`
    :   Specifies the fields to use for indexing the virtual machine launcher pods. It is recommended to use the `MAC` address as the indexing field to get network flows enrichment for secondary interfaces. If you have overlapping MAC addresses between pods, then additional indexing fields, such as `IP` and `Interface`, can be added to ensure accurate enrichment.

    `MAC`
    :   Specifies the MAC address as an indexing field value. Add `MAC` to the `index` field list if your additional network information includes a MAC address.

    `spec.processor.advanced.secondaryNetworks.name`
    :   Specifies the name of the secondary network as found in the `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/network-status` annotation of the virtual machine launcher pod. The format is typically `<namespace>/<network_attachment_definition_name>`.

**Verification**

1.  Observe VM traffic:
    1.  Navigate to the **Network Traffic** page.
    1.  Filter by **Source** IP using your virtual machine IP found in `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/network-status` annotation.
    1.  View both **Source** and **Destination** fields, which should be enriched, and identify the VM launcher pods and the VM instance as owners.
