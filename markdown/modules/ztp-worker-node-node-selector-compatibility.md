# PTP and SR-IOV node selector compatibility {id="ztp-additional-worker-node-selector-comp_{{ context }}"}

The PTP configuration resources and SR-IOV network node policies use `node-role.kubernetes.io/master: ""` as the node selector. If the additional worker node has the same NIC configuration as the control plane node, the policies used to configure the control plane node can be reused for the worker node. However, the node selector must be changed to select both node types, for example with the `"node-role.kubernetes.io/worker"` label.
