# Virtualized control plane architecture {id="con_virt-vcp-architecture_{{ context }}"}

A virtualized control plane deployment runs control plane components as VMs on a hosting cluster, providing hypervisor-level isolation between clusters. {._abstract}

A single hosting cluster can support multiple target clusters by running each cluster’s control plane VMs in separate namespaces.
This consolidation reduces hardware costs while maintaining isolation.
The target cluster’s worker nodes run on separate infrastructure, either physical servers or VMs on different hosts.

For high availability, distribute control plane VMs across different physical nodes on the hosting cluster.
This anti-affinity placement ensures that if a physical node fails, only one control plane VM is affected and the remaining nodes maintain etcd quorum.
Configure anti-affinity using pod anti-affinity rules or topology spread constraints in the VM specifications.
