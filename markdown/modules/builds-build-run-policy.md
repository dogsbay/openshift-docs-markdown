# Build run policy {id="builds-build-run-policy_{{ context }}"}

The build run policy describes the order in which the builds created from the build configuration should run. This can be done by changing the value of the `runPolicy` field in the `spec` section of the `Build` specification.

It is also possible to change the `runPolicy` value for existing build configurations, by:

*   Changing `Parallel` to `Serial` or `SerialLatestOnly` and triggering a new build from this configuration causes the new build to wait until all parallel builds complete as the serial build can only run alone.
*   Changing `Serial` to `SerialLatestOnly` and triggering a new build causes cancellation of all existing builds in queue, except the currently running build and the most recently created build. The newest build runs next.
