# Release notes for Kernel Module Management Operator 2.5.1 {id="kmm-2-5-1-RN_{{ context }}"}

Review what is new, changed, or fixed in Kernel Module Management Operator 2.5.1 on {{ product_title }}. {._abstract}

The following known issues apply to this release:

*   Kernel Module Management (KMM) version 2.5 does not run on Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) clusters or any other cluster that doesn’t install the `MachineConfig` CRD.
    *   **Cause**: This happens because the BMC controller that monitors `MachineConfig` objects on clusters cannot find these objects on ROSA clusters because they do not exist.
    *   **Consequence**: Causes the BMC controller to fail and the KMM controller pods to continually restart.
    *   **Fix**: In this version, the Operator verifies that the `MachineConfig` CRD is present on a cluster and runs the BMC controller on a cluster only when the `MachineConfig` CRD is present.
    *   **Result**: ROSA controller pods start successfully.
