# Adding a custom CA during cluster installation  {id="adding-a-custom-CA-during-cluster-installation_{{ context }}"}

To add a custom Certificate Authority (CA) to your {{ product_title }} cluster during initial cluster installation, you can add the CA certificate to your `install-config.yaml` file. Adding the CA certificate during installation ensures that your cluster trusts the CA after installation. {._abstract}

The following procedure uses the `additionalTrustBundle` parameter. If you are also configuring an egress proxy, you can add this parameter to your `install-config.yaml` file along with your proxy configuration. For more information on the available proxy settings, see the "Configuring the cluster-wide proxy" chapter.

**Prerequisites**

*   You have access to the `install-config.yaml` file for your cluster installation.
*   You have your custom CA certificate avalable in PEM-encoded format.

**Procedure**

1.  Open your `install-config.yaml` file.
1.  Add the `additionalTrustBundle` parameter with your PEM-encoded CA certificate:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    baseDomain: my.domain.com
    metadata:
      name: my-cluster
    additionalTrustBundle: |
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      <MY_PEM_ENCODED_CA_CERT>
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    ```

    where:

    `additionalTrustBundle`
    :   Specifies the custom CA certificate that you want the cluster to trust. The installation program uses the certificate to generate a `user-ca-bundle` `ConfigMap` object in the `openshift-config` namespace.

1.  Save the `install-config.yaml` file and continue with your cluster installation.
