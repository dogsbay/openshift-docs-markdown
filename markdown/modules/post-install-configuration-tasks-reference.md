# Postinstallation configuration tasks {id="post-install-tasks_{{ context }}"}

You can perform the postinstallation configuration tasks to configure your environment to meet your needs. {._abstract}

The following lists details these configurations:

*   Configure operating system features: The Machine Config Operator (MCO) manages `MachineConfig` objects. By using the MCO, you can configure nodes and custom resources.
*   Configure cluster features. You can modify the following features of an {{ product_title }} cluster:
    *   Image registry
    *   Networking configuration
    *   Image build behavior
    *   Identity provider
    *   The etcd configuration
    *   Machine set creation to handle the workloads
    *   Cloud provider credential management
*   Configuring a private cluster: By default, the installation program provisions {{ product_title }} by using a publicly accessible DNS and endpoints. To make your cluster accessible only from within an internal network, configure the following components to make them private:
    *   DNS
    *   Ingress Controller
    *   API server
*   Perform node operations: By default, {{ product_title }} uses {{ op_system_first }} compute machines. You can perform the following node operations:
    *   Add and remove compute machines.
    *   Add and remove taints and tolerations.
    *   Configure the maximum number of pods per node.
    *   Enable Device Manager.
*   Configure users: Users can authenticate themselves to the API by using OAuth access tokens. You can configure OAuth to perform the following tasks:
    *   Specify an identity provider.
    *   Use role-based access control to define and grant permissions to users.
    *   Install an Operator from the software catalog.
*   Configuring alert notifications: By default, firing alerts are displayed on the Alerting UI of the web console. You can also configure {{ product_title }} to send alert notifications to external systems.
