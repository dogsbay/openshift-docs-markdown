You can reduce the time taken for cluster installation by using accelerated provisioning of {{ ztp }} for {{ sno }}.
Accelerated ZTP speeds up installation by applying Day 2 manifests derived from policies at an earlier stage.


:::important

Accelerated provisioning of {{ ztp }} is supported only when installing {{ sno }} with Assisted Installer. Otherwise this installation method will fail.

## Activating accelerated ZTP {id="activating-accelerated-ztp_{{ context }}"}

You can activate accelerated ZTP using the `spec.clusters.clusterLabels.accelerated-ztp` label, as in the following example:

```yaml title="Example Accelerated ZTP ClusterInstance CR."
apiVersion: siteconfig.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterInstance
metadata:
  name: "example-sno"
  namespace: "example-sno"
spec:
  baseDomain: "example.com"
  pullSecretRef:
    name: "assisted-deployment-pull-secret"
  clusterImageSetNameRef: "openshift-4.22"
  sshPublicKey: "ssh-rsa AAAA..."
  extraLabels:
    ManagedCluster:                    # <-- Resource type as outer key
      common: "true"
      group-du-sno: ""
      sites: "example-sno"
      accelerated-ztp: full            # <-- Accelerated ZTP label
# ...
```

You can use `accelerated-ztp: full` to fully automate the accelerated process.
{{ ztp }} updates the `AgentClusterInstall` resource with a reference to the accelerated {{ ztp }} `ConfigMap`, and includes resources extracted from policies by {{ cgu_operator }}, and accelerated ZTP job manifests.

If you use `accelerated-ztp: partial`, {{ ztp }} does not include the accelerated job manifests, but includes policy-derived objects created during the cluster installation of the following `kind` types:

*   `PerformanceProfile.performance.openshift.io`
*   `Tuned.tuned.openshift.io`
*   `Namespace`
*   `CatalogSource.operators.coreos.com`
*   `ContainerRuntimeConfig.machineconfiguration.openshift.io`

This partial acceleration can reduce the number of reboots done by the node when applying resources of the kind `Performance Profile`, `Tuned`, and `ContainerRuntimeConfig`.
{{ cgu_operator }} installs the Operator subscriptions derived from policies after {{ rh_rhacm }} completes the import of the cluster, following the same flow as standard {{ ztp }}.

The benefits of accelerated ZTP increase with the scale of your deployment.
Using `accelerated-ztp: full` gives more benefit on a large number of clusters.
With a smaller number of clusters, the reduction in installation time is less significant.
Full accelerated ZTP leaves behind a namespace and a completed job on the spoke that need to be manually removed.

One benefit of using `accelerated-ztp: partial` is that you can override the functionality of the on-spoke job if something goes wrong with the stock implementation or if you require a custom functionality.

## The accelerated ZTP process {id="the-accelerated-ztp-process_{{ context }}"}

Accelerated ZTP uses an additional `ConfigMap` to create the resources derived from policies on the spoke cluster.
The standard `ConfigMap` includes manifests that the {{ ztp }} workflow uses to customize cluster installs.

{{ cgu_operator }} detects that the `accelerated-ztp` label is set and then creates a second `ConfigMap`.
As part of accelerated ZTP, the SiteConfig Operator adds a reference to that second `ConfigMap` using the naming convention `<spoke-cluster-name>-aztp`.

After {{ cgu_operator }} creates that second `ConfigMap`, it finds all policies bound to the managed cluster and extracts the {{ ztp }} profile information.
{{ cgu_operator }} adds the {{ ztp }} profile information to the `<spoke-cluster-name>-aztp` `ConfigMap` custom resource (CR) and applies the CR to the hub cluster API.
