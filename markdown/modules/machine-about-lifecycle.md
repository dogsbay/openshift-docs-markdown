# The machine lifecycle {id="machine-about-lifecycle_{{ context }}"}

Understanding the machine lifecycle can help you troubleshoot machine issues. The lifecycle begins with the request to provision a machine and continues until the machine no longer exists. {._abstract}

The machine lifecycle proceeds in the following order. Interruptions due to errors or lifecycle hooks are not included in this overview.

1.  There is a request to provision a new machine for one of the following reasons:
    *   A cluster administrator scales a machine set such that it requires additional machines.
    *   An autoscaling policy scales machine set such that it requires additional machines.
    *   A machine that is managed by a machine set fails or is deleted and the machine set creates a replacement to maintain the required number of machines.
1.  The machine enters the `Provisioning` phase.
1.  The infrastructure provider creates an instance for the machine.
1.  The machine has a provider ID or address and enters the `Provisioned` phase.
1.  The Ignition configuration file is processed.
1.  The kubelet issues a certificate signing request (CSR).
1.  The cluster machine approver approves the CSR.
1.  The machine becomes a node and enters the `Running` phase.
1.  An existing machine is slated for deletion for one of the following reasons:
    *   A user with `cluster-admin` permissions uses the `oc delete machine` command.
    *   The machine gets a `machine.openshift.io/delete-machine` annotation.
    *   The machine set that manages the machine marks it for deletion to reduce the replica count as part of reconciliation.
    *   The cluster autoscaler identifies a node that is unnecessary to meet the deployment needs of the cluster.
    *   A machine health check is configured to replace an unhealthy machine.
1.  The machine enters the `Deleting` phase, in which it is marked for deletion but is still present in the API.
1.  The machine controller removes the instance from the infrastructure provider.
1.  The machine controller deletes the `Node` object.
