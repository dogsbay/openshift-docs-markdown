# Booting the remaining cluster hosts {id="virt-installing-ove-hosts_{{ context }}"}

After you have configured initial cluster details in the installation web console and have a defined cluster topology, you must boot the remaining machines that will make up your cluster from the ISO image. {._abstract}


:::note

You can boot non-rendezvous node machines earlier in the installation process, even before you designate a machine as the rendezvous node. However, you must know the valid IP address that you will select for the rendezvous node.

When you boot your non-rendezvous node machines, the machines will perform a check to see if an Assisted Service is running at the specified rendezvous IP address.
If the service is not yet running, a warning appears to confirm whether you would still like to proceed booting the machine from the ISO image.

:::


**Prerequisites**

*   You have downloaded the installation ISO.

**Procedure**

1.  Attach the ISO image to a machine and boot the machine from this image.
You can also boot from a USB drive containing the ISO image.
1.  Wait for a machine to boot from the image and display the **Rendezvous node setup** menu.
1.  Enter the rendezvous node IP address in the **Rendezvous node setup** menu and select **Save rendezvous IP**.
1.  Select **Save and Continue**.
1.  Repeat this process for each remaining machine that will comprise the hosts in your cluster.
