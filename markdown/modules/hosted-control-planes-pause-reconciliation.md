# Pausing the reconciliation of a hosted cluster and hosted control plane {id="hosted-control-planes-pause-reconciliation_{{ context }}"}

If you are a cluster instance administrator, you can pause the reconciliation of a hosted cluster and hosted control plane. You might want to pause reconciliation when you back up and restore an etcd database or when you need to debug problems with a hosted cluster or hosted control plane. {._abstract}

**Procedure**

1.  To pause reconciliation for a hosted cluster and hosted control plane, populate the `pausedUntil` field of the `HostedCluster` resource.
    *   To pause the reconciliation until a specific time, enter the following command:
        ```terminal
        $ oc patch -n <hosted_cluster_namespace> \
          hostedclusters/<hosted_cluster_name> \
          -p '{"spec":{"pausedUntil":"<timestamp>"}}' \
          --type=merge
        ```

        Replace `<timestamp>` with a timestamp in the RFC339 format; for example, `2024-03-03T03:28:48Z`. The reconciliation is paused until the specified time is passed.
    *   To pause the reconciliation indefinitely, enter the following command:
        ```terminal
        $ oc patch -n <hosted_cluster_namespace> \
          hostedclusters/<hosted_cluster_name> \
          -p '{"spec":{"pausedUntil":"true"}}' \
          --type=merge
        ```

        The reconciliation is paused until you remove the field from the `HostedCluster` resource.

        When the pause reconciliation field is populated for the `HostedCluster` resource, the field is automatically added to the associated `HostedControlPlane` resource.
1.  To remove the `pausedUntil` field, enter the following patch command:
    ```terminal
    $ oc patch -n <hosted_cluster_namespace> \
      hostedclusters/<hosted_cluster_name> \
      -p '{"spec":{"pausedUntil":null}}' \
      --type=merge
    ```
