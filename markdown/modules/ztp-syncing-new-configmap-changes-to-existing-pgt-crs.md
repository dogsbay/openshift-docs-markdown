# Syncing new ConfigMap changes to existing PolicyGenerator or PolicyGentemplate CRs {id="ztp-syncing-new-configmap-changes-to-existing-pgt-crs_{{ context }}"}

You can sync updated `ConfigMap` CR changes to existing `PolicyGenerator` or `PolicyGentemplate` CRs deployed on the hub cluster. {._abstract}

**Prerequisites**

*   You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
*   You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
*   You have created a `PolicyGenerator` or `PolicyGentemplate` CR that pulls information from a `ConfigMap` CR using hub cluster templates.

**Procedure**

1.  Update the contents of your `ConfigMap` CR, and apply the changes in the hub cluster.
1.  To sync the contents of the updated `ConfigMap` CR to the deployed policy, do either of the following:
    1.  Option 1: Delete the existing policy. ArgoCD uses the `PolicyGenerator` or `PolicyGentemplate` CR to immediately recreate the deleted policy. For example, run the following command:
        ```terminal
        $ oc delete policy <policy_name> -n <policy_namespace>
        ```
    1.  Option 2: Apply a special annotation `policy.open-cluster-management.io/trigger-update` to the policy with a different value every time when you update the `ConfigMap`. For example:
        ```terminal
        $ oc annotate policy <policy_name> -n <policy_namespace> policy.open-cluster-management.io/trigger-update="1"
        ```

        :::note

        You must apply the updated policy for the changes to take effect. For more information, see [Special annotation for reprocessing](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.6/html-single/governance/index#special-annotation-processing).
        
        :::

1.  Optional: If it exists, delete the `ClusterGroupUpdate` CR that contains the policy. For example:
    ```terminal
    $ oc delete clustergroupupgrade <cgu_name> -n <cgu_namespace>
    ```
    1.  Create a new `ClusterGroupUpdate` CR that includes the policy to apply with the updated `ConfigMap` changes. For example, add the following YAML to the file `cgr-example.yaml`:
        ```yaml
        apiVersion: ran.openshift.io/v1alpha1
        kind: ClusterGroupUpgrade
        metadata:
          name: <cgr_name>
          namespace: <policy_namespace>
        spec:
          managedPolicies:
            - <managed_policy>
          enable: true
          clusters:
          - <managed_cluster_1>
          - <managed_cluster_2>
          remediationStrategy:
            maxConcurrency: 2
            timeout: 240
        ```
    1.  Apply the updated policy:
        ```terminal
        $ oc apply -f cgr-example.yaml
        ```
