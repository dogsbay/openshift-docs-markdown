# High performance multicast {id="nw-high-performance-multicast_{{ context }}"}

The OVN-Kubernetes network plugin supports multicast between pods on the default network. This is best used for low-bandwidth coordination or service discovery, and not high-bandwidth applications.
For applications such as streaming media, such as Internet Protocol television (IPTV) and multipoint videoconferencing, you can use Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) hardware to provide near-native performance. {._abstract}

When using additional SR-IOV interfaces for multicast:

*   Multicast packages must be sent or received by a pod through the additional SR-IOV interface.
*   The physical network which connects the SR-IOV interfaces decides the
multicast routing and topology, which is not controlled by {{ product_title }}.
