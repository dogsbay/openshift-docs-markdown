# Expanding CSI volumes {id="expanding-csi-volumes_{{ context }}"}

You can use the Container Storage Interface (CSI) to expand storage volumes after they have already been created. {._abstract}


:::important

Shrinking persistent volumes (PVs) is _not_ supported.

:::


**Prerequisites**

*   The underlying CSI driver supports resize. 

    For information about which CSI drivers support resizing, see under the _Additional resources_ section "CSI drivers supported by {{ product_title }}".
*   Dynamic provisioning is used.
*   The controlling `StorageClass` object has `allowVolumeExpansion` set to `true`. 

    For more information, see section _Enabling volume expansion support_.

**Procedure**

*   For the persistent volume claim (PVC), set `.spec.resources.requests.storage` to the desired new size.

**Verification**

*   To confirm that the resize is finished, look at the `status.conditions` field of the PVC . {{ product_title }} adds the `Resizing` condition to the PVC during expansion, which is removed after expansion completes.
