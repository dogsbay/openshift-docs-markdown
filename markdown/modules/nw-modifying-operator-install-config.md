# Specifying advanced network configuration {id="modifying-nwoperator-config-startup_{{ context }}"}

To integrate your {{ product_title }} cluster with your existing network environment, you can specify advanced network configuration in a manifest before you install the cluster. Advanced network configuration can be configured only during cluster installation. {._abstract}


:::important

Customizing your network configuration by modifying the {{ product_title }} manifest files created by the installation program is not supported. Applying a manifest file that you create, as in the following procedure, is supported.

:::


**Prerequisites**

*   You have created the `install-config.yaml` file and completed any modifications to it.

**Procedure**

1.  Change to the directory that contains the installation program and create the manifests:
    ```terminal
    $ ./openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory>
    ```

    The `<installation_directory>` specifies the name of the directory that contains the `install-config.yaml` file for your cluster.
1.  Create a stub manifest file for the advanced network configuration that is named `cluster-network-03-config.yml` in the `<installation_directory>/manifests/` directory:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
    kind: Network
    metadata:
      name: cluster
    spec:
    ```
1.  Specify the advanced network configuration for your cluster in the `cluster-network-03-config.yml` file, such as in the following example:
    ```yaml title="Enable IPsec for the OVN-Kubernetes network provider"
    apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
    kind: Network
    metadata:
      name: cluster
    spec:
      defaultNetwork:
        ovnKubernetesConfig:
          ipsecConfig:
            mode: Full
    ```
1.  Optional: Back up the `manifests/cluster-network-03-config.yml` file. The
installation program consumes the `manifests/` directory when you create the
Ignition config files.

{% if not vsphere_ipi %}
1.  Remove the Kubernetes manifest files that define the control plane machines and compute `MachineSets`:
    ```terminal
    $ rm -f openshift/99_openshift-cluster-api_master-machines-*.yaml openshift/99_openshift-cluster-api_worker-machineset-*.yaml
    ```

    Because you create and manage these resources yourself, you do not have
    to initialize them.
    *   You can preserve the `MachineSet` files to create compute machines by using the machine API, but you must update references to them to match your environment.
