# Adding unauthenticated groups to cluster roles {id="unauthenticated-users-cluster-role-bindings_{{ context }}"}

Grant unauthenticated users access to specific cluster roles to enable features that require cluster access without authentication, such as external webhooks or automated token management. {._abstract}

You can add unauthenticated users to the following cluster roles:

*   `system:scope-impersonation`
*   `system:webhook`
*   `system:oauth-token-deleter`
*   `self-access-reviewer`


:::important

Always verify compliance with your organization’s security standards when modifying unauthenticated access.

**Prerequisites**

*   You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
*   You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

**Procedure**

1.  Create a YAML file named `add-<cluster_role>-unauth.yaml` and add the following content:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: ClusterRoleBinding
    metadata:
     annotations:
       rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate: "true"
     name: <cluster_role>access-unauthenticated
    roleRef:
     apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
     kind: ClusterRole
     name: <cluster_role>
    subjects:
     - apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
       kind: Group
       name: system:unauthenticated
    ```
1.  Apply the configuration by running the following command:
    ```terminal
    $ oc apply -f add-<cluster_role>.yaml
    ```
