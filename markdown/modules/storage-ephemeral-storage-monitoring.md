# Monitoring ephemeral storage {id="storage-ephemeral-storage-monitoring_{{ context }}"}

Monitor ephemeral storage usage with the `/bin/df` utility to track disk space consumption on `/var/lib/kubelet` and `/var/lib/containers`. Regular monitoring helps you identify storage-hungry workloads and adjust resource limits before kubelet evicts pods due to storage exhaustion. {._abstract}

When you use the `df` command, the available space for only `/var/lib/kubelet` is shown if `/var/lib/containers` is placed on a separate disk by the cluster administrator.

You can use `/bin/df` as a tool to monitor ephemeral storage usage on the volume where ephemeral container data is located, which is `/var/lib/kubelet` and `/var/lib/containers`. The available space for only `/var/lib/kubelet` is shown when you use the `df` command if `/var/lib/containers` is placed on a separate disk by the cluster administrator.

**Procedure**

*   To show the human-readable values of used and available space in `/var/lib`, run the following command:
    ```terminal
    $ df -h /var/lib
    ```

    The output shows the ephemeral storage usage in `/var/lib`:
    ```terminal title="Example output"
