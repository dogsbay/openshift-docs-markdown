# Adding compute machines to clusters with user-provisioned infrastructure manually {#adding-compute-user-infra-general}

To scale a OpenShift Container Platform cluster that uses user-provisioned infrastructure, you can manually add compute machines during or after installation. The postinstallation process requires some of the same configuration files and parameters that you used for installation.

## Adding compute machines to Amazon Web Services {#upi-adding-compute-aws}

You can add more compute machines to your OpenShift Container Platform cluster on AWS.

See [Adding compute machines to AWS by using CloudFormation templates](/openshift-docs-markdown/machine_management/user_infra/adding-aws-compute-user-infra#adding-aws-compute-user-infra) for more information.

## Adding compute machines to Microsoft Azure {#upi-adding-compute-azure}

You can add more compute machines to your OpenShift Container Platform cluster on Microsoft Azure.

See [Creating additional worker machines in Azure](/openshift-docs-markdown/installing/installing_azure/upi/installing-azure-user-infra#installation-creating-azure-worker_installing-azure-user-infra) for more information.

## Adding compute machines to Azure Stack Hub {#upi-adding-compute-ash}

You can add more compute machines to your OpenShift Container Platform cluster on Azure Stack Hub.

See [Creating additional worker machines in Azure Stack Hub](/openshift-docs-markdown/installing/installing_azure_stack_hub/upi/installing-azure-stack-hub-user-infra#installation-creating-azure-worker_installing-azure-stack-hub-user-infra) for more information.

## Adding compute machines to Google Cloud {#upi-adding-compute-gcp}

You can add more compute machines to your OpenShift Container Platform cluster on GCP.

See [Creating additional worker machines in Google Cloud](/openshift-docs-markdown/installing/installing_gcp/installing-restricted-networks-gcp#installation-creating-gcp-worker_installing-restricted-networks-gcp) for more information.

## Adding compute machines to vSphere {#upi-adding-compute-vsphere}

You can use compute machine sets to automate the creation of additional compute machines for your OpenShift Container Platform cluster on vSphere.

See [use compute machine sets](/openshift-docs-markdown/machine_management/creating_machinesets/creating-machineset-vsphere#creating-machineset-vsphere) for more information.

You can manually add more compute machines to your cluster.

See [Adding compute machines to vSphere manually](/openshift-docs-markdown/machine_management/user_infra/adding-vsphere-compute-user-infra#adding-vsphere-compute-user-infra) for more information.

You can add bare-metal compute machines to your cluster.

See [Adding bare-metal compute machines to a vSphere cluster](/openshift-docs-markdown/machine_management/user_infra/adding-bare-metal-compute-vsphere-user-infra#adding-bare-metal-compute-vsphere-user-infra) for more information.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Bare-metal nodes on vSphere clusters is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

## Adding compute machines to bare metal {#upi-adding-compute-baremetal}

You can add more compute machines to your OpenShift Container Platform cluster on bare metal.

See [Adding compute machines to bare metal](/openshift-docs-markdown/machine_management/user_infra/adding-bare-metal-compute-user-infra#adding-bare-metal-compute-user-infra) for more information.
