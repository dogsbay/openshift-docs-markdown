# Assigning a secondary network to a VRF {#assigning-a-secondary-network-to-a-vrf}

As a cluster administrator, you can configure a secondary network for a virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) domain by using the CNI VRF plugin. The virtual network that this plugin creates is associated with the physical interface that you specify.

Using a secondary network with a VRF instance has the following advantages:

Workload isolation
:   Isolate workload traffic by configuring a VRF instance for the secondary network.

Improved security
:   Enable improved security through isolated network paths in the VRF domain.

Multi-tenancy support
:   Support multi-tenancy through network segmentation with a unique routing table in the VRF domain for each tenant.

> [!NOTE]
> Applications that use VRFs must bind to a specific device. The common usage is to use the `SO_BINDTODEVICE` option for a socket. The `SO_BINDTODEVICE` option binds the socket to the device that is specified in the passed interface name, for example, `eth1`. To use the `SO_BINDTODEVICE` option, the application must have `CAP_NET_RAW` capabilities.
>
> Using a VRF through the `ip vrf exec` command is not supported in OpenShift Container Platform pods. To use VRF, bind applications directly to the VRF interface.
